a simple way to type fancy unicode letters: "{g-stroke}" becomes  &#x01E5;", and so on.

The motivation for this is the situation where I'm trying to input a character that I don't *want* to actually be on the keyboard, because it's not something that I type regularly. If I were actually going to type a document or something (say, transcribe something) in a language that has {open-e} as part of its orthography, okay, I'll find & install a keyboard. If I'm just trying to make a comment on the linguistics reddit (which is what prompted me to do this app, believe it or not), I just want to a fast way to get some letters without too much thinking.
