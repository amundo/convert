a simple way to type fancy unicode letters: "{g-stroke}" becomes
&#x01E5;", and so on.

The motivation for this is the situation where I'm trying to input
a character that I don't *want* to actually be on the keyboard,
because it's not something that I type regularly. If I were actually
going to type a document or something (say, transcribe something)
in a language that has {open-e} as part of its orthography, okay,
I'll find & install a keyboard. If I'm just trying to make a comment
on the linguistics reddit (which is what prompted me to do this
app, believe it or not), I just want to a fast way to get some
letters without too much thinking.
